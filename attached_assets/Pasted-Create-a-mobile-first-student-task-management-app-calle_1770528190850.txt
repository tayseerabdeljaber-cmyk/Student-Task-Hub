Create a mobile-first student task management app called "StudyFlow" (or your preferred name).

TECH STACK:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Mobile-responsive design (optimize for 375px width)

APP STRUCTURE:

1. THREE MAIN SCREENS:

A) TODAY VIEW (Home/Default Screen):
- Large header showing current day and date (e.g., "Saturday, February 8")
- Friendly greeting based on time of day ("Good morning!" / "Good afternoon!")
- "DUE TODAY" section:
  * Display 2-3 assignment cards
  * Each card shows: emoji icon (📝/📖/🧪), assignment name, course code, due time
  * Cards have soft shadows, rounded corners, white background
- "COMING UP" section:
  * Simple list of next 3 upcoming assignments
  * Format: "Tomorrow: Quiz - PHYS 172"
- Reassurance message at bottom: "✅ You're all caught up for today" (only show when today's tasks are done)
- If tasks remain: Show "2 tasks left today" message

B) WEEK CALENDAR VIEW:
- Header: "Week of Feb 8-14"
- Horizontal scrollable week strip showing 7 days
- Each day shows:
  * Day name (Sun, Mon, Tue)
  * Date number (8, 9, 10)
  * Dot indicators for number of tasks (1-3 dots)
  * Current day is highlighted/underlined
- Below week strip: Expanded view of selected day
- Selected day shows:
  * Day name and date as subheader
  * Time-sorted list of assignments with time stamps (9:00 AM, 11:59 PM)
  * Same card style as Today view
- Tapping a day in the week strip updates the expanded view

C) ALL TASKS VIEW:
- Header: "All Assignments"
- Simple filter dropdown: "All Classes" with options (CS 159, PHYS 172, ENGR 132, CHM 115, MATH 166)
- Tasks grouped by urgency:
  * "OVERDUE" section (red accent, 🔴 indicator)
  * "THIS WEEK" section (blue accent)
  * "LATER" section (collapsed by default, shows "Tap to expand (15 more)")
- Each task card shows: assignment name, course code, due date/time
- Clean vertical list, NO table/spreadsheet layout

2. BOTTOM NAVIGATION (Fixed at bottom on all screens):
- Three tabs with icons:
  * Today (home icon) - links to Today View
  * Week (calendar icon) - links to Week View  
  * All (list icon) - links to All Tasks View
- Active tab is highlighted in blue
- Icons are simple and clean

3. DESIGN SYSTEM:
- Color palette:
  * Primary blue: #6366f1 (indigo-500)
  * Background: #f8fafc (slate-50)
  * Cards: white with subtle shadow
  * Text: #1e293b (slate-800) for headings, #64748b (slate-600) for body
  * Red accent for overdue: #ef4444 (red-500)
  * Green for success: #10b981 (emerald-500)
- Typography:
  * Headers: 24px, semi-bold
  * Subheaders: 18px, medium
  * Body: 14-16px, regular
- Spacing: Generous padding (16-24px) for mobile touch targets
- Border radius: 12px for cards
- Shadows: Soft, subtle (shadow-sm from Tailwind)

4. SAMPLE DATA (Use realistic Purdue University courses):
Include at least 10 sample assignments across these courses:
- CS 159 (Intro to Programming)
- PHYS 172 (Modern Mechanics)
- ENGR 132 (Engineering Design)
- CHM 115 (General Chemistry)
- MATH 166 (Calculus)

Sample assignments:
- "Homework 2 (Vocareum)" due Feb 8, 11:00 PM - CS 159
- "Quiz - Chapter 3" due Feb 9, 9:00 AM - PHYS 172
- "Lab Report 1" due Feb 10, 11:59 PM - ENGR 132
- "Problem Set 4" due Feb 12, 11:59 PM - MATH 166
- "Read Chapter 5" due Feb 13, 10:30 AM - CHM 115
- "Exam 1" due Feb 15, 8:00 AM - PHYS 172
Include some overdue assignments and some far in the future

5. INTERACTIVITY:
- Bottom nav switches between screens smoothly
- Week view: clicking different days updates the content below
- All Tasks view: filter dropdown actually filters assignments
- All Tasks view: "LATER" section expands/collapses on click
- Assignments can be checked off (toggle completed state)

6. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
- Design for 375px width (iPhone size)
- Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px)
- Smooth scrolling
- No horizontal scroll
- Readable font sizes on mobile

7. CODE QUALITY:
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Create reusable components: TaskCard, DayStrip, NavigationBar
- Clean, commented code
- Proper TypeScript types for tasks, courses, dates
- Use state management for selected day, filter, completed tasks

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
- This should feel STRESS-RELIEVING, not overwhelming
- Minimize visual clutter
- Focus on clarity: "What do I need to do TODAY?"
- Calming color scheme (blues/whites, not harsh reds everywhere)
- Big, clear reassurance messages
- Mobile-first (students will use this on their phones)

OUTPUT:
- Fully functional React app
- All three screens working and navigable
- Sample data populated
- Ready to run immediately
- Clean file structure (components/, data/, utils/)
