Great start! Now let's add the missing features and complete the app. Make these changes:

PART 1: ADD LOGIN/ONBOARDING FLOW

1. CREATE LOGIN SCREEN (New default landing page):
- Clean, simple design with app logo/name at top
- Welcoming headline: "Never miss an assignment again"
- Subheadline: "Your stress-free student planner"
- Two input fields:
  * "Student's Email" (email input)
  * "Password" (password input, masked)
- Large "Sign In" button (blue, rounded)
- Below button: "Don't have an account? Sign up" link
- For MVP: Any email/password combo works (no real auth yet)
- After clicking Sign In, navigate to Today View

2. CREATE SIGNUP SCREEN:
- Similar clean design
- Fields:
  * "First Name"
  * "Email"  
  * "Password"
  * "University" (dropdown with options: Purdue University, IU Bloomington, Notre Dame, Other)
- "Create Account" button
- "Already have an account? Sign in" link
- After signup, navigate to Today View

3. ADD ONBOARDING (Optional, after signup):
- Single screen: "Let's connect your accounts"
- Large button: "Connect Brightspace" (with Brightspace logo if possible)
- "Skip for now" link at bottom
- For now, clicking either goes to Today View
- Store connected state in localStorage

PART 2: ENHANCE TODAY VIEW

4. ADD MORE DETAILS TO TODAY VIEW:
- Add "Study Streak" counter in top right corner:
  * Shows: "5 day streak 🔥" 
  * Small, doesn't distract from main content
- Add time-based greeting logic:
  * Before 12pm: "Good morning!"
  * 12pm-5pm: "Good afternoon!"  
  * After 5pm: "Good evening!"
- Each task card should show:
  * Platform badge (small pill): "Brightspace", "Gradescope", "Piazza", etc.
  * Color-coded by course (each course gets a color)
  * Checkbox to mark complete (left side of card)
  * When checked, card gets strikethrough and faded opacity
- Add "Focus Mode" button at top:
  * When clicked, shows ONLY the next task due
  * Hides everything else
  * "Exit Focus Mode" to go back
- Empty state when no tasks today:
  * Large "🎉 Nothing due today!"
  * "Enjoy your free time" message
  * Still show "COMING UP" section

PART 3: ENHANCE WEEK VIEW

5. IMPROVE WEEK CALENDAR:
- Add month navigation arrows (< February 2026 >)
- Week strip should:
  * Auto-scroll to current day on load
  * Highlight current day with blue background
  * Show task count numbers (not just dots): "3 tasks"
- In expanded day view:
  * Group by time of day: "Morning (before 12pm)", "Afternoon (12-5pm)", "Evening (after 5pm)"
  * Add "Add Task" button at bottom (for now, just shows alert "Coming soon!")
- Add quick "Jump to Today" button if viewing a different day

PART 4: ENHANCE ALL TASKS VIEW

6. IMPROVE ALL TASKS:
- Filter dropdown should actually work:
  * Options: All Classes, CS 159, PHYS 172, ENGR 132, CHM 115, MATH 166
  * Filtering updates the list in real-time
- Add search bar at top:
  * Placeholder: "Search assignments..."
  * Filters by assignment name as user types
- "LATER" section collapse/expand:
  * Shows "Tap to expand (15 more)" when collapsed
  * Clicking expands to show all tasks
  * When expanded, shows "Collapse" 
- Add sort options:
  * Dropdown in top right: "Sort by: Due Date, Course, Priority"
- Each task should have:
  * Swipe left to delete (or trash icon on right)
  * Tap task to see full details (modal popup showing description, links, etc.)

PART 5: ADD SETTINGS SCREEN

7. CREATE SETTINGS (Add 4th tab to bottom nav):
- Bottom nav now has 4 tabs: Today, Week, All, Settings (gear icon)
- Settings screen includes:
  * Profile section: Shows name, email, university
  * "Connected Accounts" section:
    - List of connected platforms (Brightspace, Gradescope, etc.)
    - Each has toggle switch and "Reconnect" button
    - "Add Platform" button
  * "Notifications" section:
    - Toggle for push notifications
    - "Remind me" dropdown: 1 hour before, 1 day before, 1 week before
  * "Study Streak" section:
    - Current streak count
    - "Streak history" (shows calendar grid)
  * "Theme" section:
    - Toggle for dark mode (don't implement yet, just UI)
  * "About" section:
    - App version
    - "Give Feedback" button
    - "Log Out" button (returns to login screen)

PART 6: ADD SMART FEATURES

8. IMPLEMENT SMART NOTIFICATIONS (UI only for now):
- Add notifications icon in top right of Today View
- Clicking shows dropdown with sample notifications:
  * "CS Homework 2 due in 2 hours"
  * "Don't forget: PHYS Quiz tomorrow at 9am"
  * "You're on a 5-day streak! Keep it up 🔥"
- Mark notifications as read

9. ADD STUDY PLAN FEATURE (Premium upsell):
- On Today View, add button: "Generate Study Plan ✨" (sparkle indicates premium)
- Clicking shows modal:
  * "Upgrade to Premium"
  * "Get AI-powered study plans based on your workload"
  * Shows sample study plan (blocked out with blur)
  * "Upgrade Now" button ($4.99/month)
  * "Maybe Later" link
- This sets up your monetization strategy

PART 7: DATA IMPROVEMENTS

10. MAKE SAMPLE DATA MORE REALISTIC:
- Add at least 20 assignments total
- Include variety:
  * Homework, Quizzes, Exams, Labs, Reading, Projects
  * Different platforms: Brightspace, Gradescope, Piazza, PearsonMyLab, WebAssign
  * Different times: 8:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 11:59 PM, etc.
  * Some all-day events (Exam 1, Project Due)
- Add course colors:
  * CS 159: Blue (#3b82f6)
  * PHYS 172: Purple (#a855f7)
  * ENGR 132: Orange (#f97316)
  * CHM 115: Green (#22c55e)
  * MATH 166: Red (#ef4444)

PART 8: POLISH & UX

11. ADD LOADING STATES:
- When "connecting" Brightspace (fake it):
  * Show loading spinner for 2 seconds
  * Then show success checkmark animation
- When navigating between screens:
  * Smooth fade transitions

12. ADD ANIMATIONS:
- Task cards slide in when screen loads
- Checking off task: satisfying checkmark animation
- Completing all today's tasks: confetti animation 🎉
- Bottom nav: smooth tab indicator sliding

13. RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
- Ensure everything looks perfect on:
  * iPhone SE (375px width)
  * iPhone Pro (393px width)  
  * Tablet (768px width) - should still be single column
- Test all interactions work on touch screens

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Use React state to manage: logged in status, selected filters, completed tasks, expanded sections
- Use localStorage to persist: login status, completed tasks, study streak
- Create reusable components: Modal, Button, TaskCard, FilterDropdown
- Add TypeScript interfaces for: User, Task, Course, Platform
- Use Tailwind animations and transitions

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Login/Signup flow (so users start at login)
2. Enhanced Today View with all features
3. Settings screen
4. Week View improvements
5. All Tasks improvements
6. Polish/animations

IMPORTANT: Keep the same calming, stress-free design aesthetic. Don't make it cluttered - every feature should feel like it reduces stress, not adds to it.

Build this incrementally. Start with the login flow, then enhance each screen one at a time. Let me know when each part is complete so I can test it.
